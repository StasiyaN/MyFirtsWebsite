        <h1><b>Hello, I'm Onyx, the furriest and most fabulous feline you'll ever meet!</h1></div></b></div>
        
<div class="bio"><p><b>My coat is a striking mix of jet black and pure white, like a living piece of art. The contrasting colors perfectly complement my inquisitive and playful nature.<br> I can't resist a good game of chase, and I often find myself darting around the house with lightning speed. I'm practically the Ninja of the feline world, you know.<br><br>

        As a smart and savvy cat, I've learned the art of hairdressing, or so I like to think. My elegant tail serves as the perfect canvas for my "styling" endeavors. I can't help but nibble and groom it, giving it my personal touch. It's my little secret to staying so well-groomed!
        When I'm not playing or tending to my magnificent tail, you'll find me right by my human's side.<br> I'm their constant shadow, always eager to join in whatever they're doing. I love to chat with them, a symphony of purrs and meows that only my human truly understands.<br><br>
        
        And let me tell you, when I hear the sound of someone brushing their hair, I'm on a mission! I'll race over to reclaim my rightful place as the resident hair expert. Who better than a cat like me to ensure that every strand is purr-fectly in place?
        I live a life full of adventure, filled with play, conversation, and just a hint of mischief.<br><br> <h2>I'm purrfect companion to my human</b></h2>
